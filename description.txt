WARNING: This mod has been split into Expeditions Base (this) and Expeditions Content Pack. You will lose all quest progress you made with this mod when it was in version 1. Sorry!

Add Expeditions, a quest system accesible via the Expedition Board craftable tile.
This is the core mod, providing just the quest system framework, without content.

Framework Features:
* Client-side quest viewing, tracking and completion.
* 'Fancy' UI for handling the above.
* Lists for delivering and rewards items.
* Up to 3 customisable conditions and 1 counter per quests.
* Daily random quest system, saved to world and net-synced.
* Custom currency 'Expedition Coupon' and related methods.
* Loot boxes that use an item pool generated from all installed mods.
* Hooks for detecting various things.
* Semantic time checking information.
* Bugs and glitches!

Commands:
Hold [O][K][0] when exiting the world to reset ALL quest data.
Hold [#] when exiting the world to discard quest data from unloaded mods.
